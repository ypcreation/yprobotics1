    <div class="six">The 4-axis robotic arm is a sophisticated mechanism designed for precise pick-and-place operations. It is built around the Arduino Uno development board, a versatile platform that facilitates seamless programming and control. The heart of this robotic arm lies in its four SG90 servo motors, each responsible for controlling a specific axis of movement. The SG90 servos, known for their compact size and high precision, enable the arm to articulate efficiently in a 4-axis configuration.

        To harness the full potential of this robotic marvel, users are required to upload a custom program onto the Arduino Uno. This program serves as the brain of the operation, dictating the sequence of movements, angles, and timing for the servo motors. Once the program is successfully uploaded, the robotic arm springs into action, executing its designated tasks with unparalleled accuracy.
        
        The programming logic is encapsulated within a loop, allowing for continuous and seamless operation. This loop ensures that the robotic arm can perform its pick-and-place functions repetitively and reliably, adhering to the specified instructions in the code. The versatility of the Arduino Uno as a development board further allows users to modify and add more points to the program, expanding the range of tasks the robotic arm can undertake. Whether in educational settings, research laboratories, or industrial environments, this 4-axis robotic arm stands as a testament to the fusion of precision engineering and programmable control, offering a glimpse into the future of automated manipulation.</div>
